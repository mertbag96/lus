            hard-to-share
            web addresses into clean, compact links. Whether you’re posting on social media, sending messages, or adding
            links to
            marketing emails, LUS makes your URLs more manageable, easier to remember, and more professional looking.

            Using LUS is intentionally simple. You start by pasting any long URL into the input field on the homepage
            and clicking
            the Shorten URL button. In just a moment, LUS generates a unique short link that points to your original
            address.

        <!-- Answer -->

            Yes, LUS is completely free to use. You can shorten as many links as you want without paying anything or
            creating an
            account. There are no hidden fees, subscriptions, or surprise limitations. Our goal is to make link sharing
            fast,
            accessible, and effortless for everyone.

            Do shortened links expire?

        <!-- Answer -->
        <div class="faq-answer hidden p-4 border-t border-t-dark/15 text-sm text-dark/80">
            No. Links created with LUS do not expire. Once a short URL is generated, it will continue to work
            indefinitely unless it
            violates our usage policies. This makes LUS ideal for long-term sharing, bookmarks, and permanent
            references.

        <!-- Answer -->
        <div class="faq-answer hidden p-4 border-t border-t-dark/15 text-sm text-dark/80">
            Yes. LUS automatically tracks basic click statistics for each shortened URL. This allows you to see how
            often your link
            is being accessed, which can be helpful for understanding engagement and reach without needing complex
            analytics tools.

            Short links look cleaner, are easier to share, and are less likely to break when sent through messaging apps
            or social
            platforms. With LUS, your links are more readable, more professional, and easier for people to trust and
            click.
